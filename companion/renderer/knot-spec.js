// The Knot's numbers, in one place.
//
// Everything the Knot does is tuned here: states, springs, gestures, sound,
// thread moves, surfaces. The tables in SPEC are copied verbatim from the
// approved motion playground (docs/knot-playground.html) and a test compares
// them against that file, so porting stays "copying numbers".
//
// Four blocks:
//   SPEC       the playground's executable SPEC object, unchanged.
//   inline     numbers the playground wrote as literals inside its code.
//   host       numbers only the real app needs (the playground has no mic, no
//              guide session, no light desktops).
//   character  the Knot's look and its shapes (decided 2026-11-02). Where it
//              names a state's shape or the geometry, it replaces the SPEC table.
//              character.accent is the one source for the state colours; the
//              accents in SPEC are the playground's and nothing paints them.
//
// Units: seconds, CSS pixels, radians. Springs use mass 1: [stiffness, damping].
